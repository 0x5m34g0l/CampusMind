# CampusMind

> AI-powered mobile assistant for university students

CampusMind is a mobile application designed to help university students with academic tasks using AI-powered tools.

The project follows a clear **3-tier architecture (UI → Logic → Data)** and is being developed as a learning journey to understand real software engineering principles — not just coding features.
